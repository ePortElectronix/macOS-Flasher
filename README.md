Welcome to the macOS flasher!
This is a simple shell script to flash macOS to a USB from Mavericks to Ventura. I hope you all find this useful.

  Use Instructions:

      Download this zip or use '$git clone' followed by the url to this repo assuming you haven't done so already.
      Download your macOS of choice. This script supports Mac OS X Mavericks up to macOS Ventura as of writing this. I plan to update when the next macOS comes out.
      Rename your target drive or format it with these following names as listed below:

        macOS Ventura = Ventura
        macOS Monterey = Monterey
        macOS Big Sur = BigSur
        macOS Catalina = Catalina
        macOS Mojave = Mojave
        macOS High Sierra = HighSierra
        macOS Sierra = Sierra
        Mac OS X El Capitan = ElCapitan
        Mac OS X Yosemite = Yosemite
        Mac OS X Mavericks = Mavericks

      Open Terminal and cd into the directory. Use '$cd <path to macOS-Flasher>'
      Once in the directory run '$chmod +x macOS-Flasher.sh' followed by '$./macOS-Flasher.sh'
